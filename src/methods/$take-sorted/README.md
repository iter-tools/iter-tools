Takes an iterable and returns n biggest items sorted from the smallest (the nth order statistic) to the biggest.
The function is both space efficient (only stores n items) and fast O(m log n), given m as the total items yielded by the iterable.
```js
takeSorted(3, [10, 4, 9, 2, 5, 8, 7]) // 5, 4, 2
```
It can take as a optional argument a comparator (just like Array.prototype.sort). The default one is:
```js
(a, b) => {
 if (a > b) {
    return 1
  } else if (a < b) {
    return -1
  } else {
    return 0
  }
}
```
