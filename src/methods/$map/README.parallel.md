A variant of map with more complicated logic that can optimize when you have both an async mapper callback and an
async souce iterable. It starts fetching the next item in the source iterable while waiting for the async callback
to resolve. The optional concurrency paramater dictates how many items can be read ahead from the source iterable while
still waiting for the results of previous mapper callbacks.

The default concurrency is 4.
```js
await asyncMapParallel(asyncMapper, asyncIterable);
await asyncMapParallel(10, asyncMapper, asyncIterable);
```
